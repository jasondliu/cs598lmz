# CodeGPT
* run.py: Run the pretrained models to generate code
* tests/: Contains some code snippets that crash Python, found from bugs.python.org

# Codex
## Files
* inputs: a copy of `prompts`, used by Codex
* results: the tests generated by Codex
* fuzz\_tests: all unique tests in `results`
* test: runnable tests after line deletion
* crashes: all crashing tests from `test`, according to `output`
* minimized: line-minimized crashing tests

## Code
* codex.py: generate tests via Codex (requires an API key)
* unique.py: copy all unique tests in a directory to another directory
* run.py: run the generated tests and record the results in `output`
* process.py: post-process `output` based on seed input
* minimize.py: run basic linewise delta-debugging to minimize tests.

Note that `minimize.py` does not always seem to completely minimize tests.
This is probably a bug in dividing the subsets of lines for odd numbers, or
when two lines must be deleted together (e.g., an if-statement) but they
happen to end up in different subsets.
