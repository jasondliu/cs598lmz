import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    print(a)
</code>
I get the following error:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap length is zero
</code>
But if I change the code to:
<code>import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    print(a)
    m.close()
</code>
It works fine.
I would like to know if there is a way to avoid calling <code>m.close()</code>?


A:

The <code>mmap</code> object is not aware of the file being truncated.  You can call <code>m.resize(0)</code> to make it aware.
