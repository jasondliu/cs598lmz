import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    print(a)
</code>
I get the following error:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
I'm not sure why this is happening. I'm using Python 3.6.1 on Windows 10.


A:

The problem is that you are truncating the file after you have created the mmap.  The mmap is still pointing to the old file size.  You need to either truncate the file before creating the mmap, or resize the mmap after truncating the file.
