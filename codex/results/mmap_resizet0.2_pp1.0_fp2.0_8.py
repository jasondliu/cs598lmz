import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
This code raises an exception:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
I understand that the file size has changed, but I don't understand why the mmap object doesn't reflect that. Is there a way to make it reflect the new file size?


A:

The <code>mmap</code> object is not aware of the file size. It is only aware of the size of the mapping.
You can use <code>mmap.resize()</code> to resize the mapping.
<code>with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    m.resize(f.tell())
    a = m[:]
</code>
