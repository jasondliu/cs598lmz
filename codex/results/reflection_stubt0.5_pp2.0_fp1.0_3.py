# This will raise an exception.
# The reason is that the function is expecting a code object as its first argument,
# but a generator object is passed instead.
# A code object is a Python object that contains the bytecode that implements the function body.
# A generator object is an iterable container.
# It is not a code object.

# You can see the bytecode of the function body by using the dis module.
import dis
dis.dis(fn)

# The dis module can also be used to get the bytecode of a function object.
# The function object is the function itself.
# The code object is the bytecode of the function.
dis.dis(fn.__code__)

# The bytecode of the function is not directly accessible.
# It is accessible only through the code object.
# The code object can be accessed only through the function object.

# The bytecode is a sequence of instructions.
# Each instruction is represented by an integer.
# The instruction can be decoded using the opname attribute of the dis module.
# The instruction is the index of the op
