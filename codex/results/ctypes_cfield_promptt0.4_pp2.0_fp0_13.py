# Test ctypes.CField
#
# Based on test_ctypes.py, but with some modifications
#
# This test is used to test the CField class, which is used to
# describe C-struct-like data in Python.
#
# CField is used by the ctypes array and structure classes.
#
# The test is based on the "struct" module, which is used to
# describe C-struct-like data in Python.
#
# The test is also based on the "array" module, which is used to
# describe C-array-like data in Python.
#
# The test is also based on the "ctypes" module, which is used to
# describe C-types in Python.
#
# The test is also based on the "binascii" module, which is used to
# convert between hexadecimal and binary data.
#
# The test is also based on the "os" module, which is used to
# determine the endianness of the platform.
#
# The test is also based on the "sys" module, which is used to
# determine the byteorder of the platform.
