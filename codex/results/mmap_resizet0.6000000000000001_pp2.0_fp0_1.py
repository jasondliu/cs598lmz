import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
The last line throws the exception:
<code>ValueError: cannot mmap an empty file
</code>
I would like to be able to read from the file after truncating it, so I can use the same mmap.


A:

I think you have to do it in 2 steps, as shown here.
<code>import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    m.resize(0)
    a = m[:]
</code>
