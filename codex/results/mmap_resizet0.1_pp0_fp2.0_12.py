import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
This code raises <code>ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size</code>.
I think that this is because <code>mmap</code> is not aware of the truncation.
Is there a way to make <code>mmap</code> aware of the truncation?
