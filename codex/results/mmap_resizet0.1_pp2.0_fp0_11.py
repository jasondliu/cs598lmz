import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
This code will raise an exception:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap length is zero
</code>
I think the reason is that the file is truncated, so the mmap object is invalid.
But I don't know how to fix it.
I want to truncate the file and then read the mmap object.
