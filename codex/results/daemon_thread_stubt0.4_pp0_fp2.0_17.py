I am using <code>sys.stdin.read()</code> to read input from the user, but it seems that it is not working when the program is running in the background.
I am using <code>Ctrl + Z</code> to put the program in the background and <code>fg</code> to bring it back.
I am using <code>Ctrl + C</code> to terminate the program.
Is there a way to read input from the user when the program is running in the background?


A:

<code>sys.stdin</code> is the terminal's standard input. When you background the process, the terminal is no longer connected to the process, so <code>sys.stdin</code> is no longer connected to your terminal
