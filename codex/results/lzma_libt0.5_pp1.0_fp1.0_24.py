import lzma
lzma.open('test.xz')
</code>
but this gives me an error
<code>ValueError: not enough data
</code>
How can I read a .xz file in Python?


A:

The <code>lzma</code> module does not support the <code>.xz</code> format, as it is a newer format that is not as widely used.  You will need to use another library such as <code>backports.lzma</code> or <code>pyliblzma</code>.
