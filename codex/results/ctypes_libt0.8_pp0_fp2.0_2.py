Now to the actual phishing part.  I know there are a lot of ways to go about the phishing, but I would like to use pyinstaller to compile my phishing.py to a standalone executable.  From there, and I am not sure if this is possible, I would like to make this executable part of the install wizard when a user clicks on the installer.  Is this possible?  Will pyinstaller include the exe in the installer?  If this is possible, then I can send the installer which has a link to the malicious website.  I have set up fake websites and checked the code in the inspect mode on the browsers to make sure that it is an exact copy of the website I am trying to phish.  So, I am pretty sure that this will work.  I just need to know if there is a way to put the executable into the installer so that when the user clicks on the installer, it installs the phishing software on their computer, and thus, bypassing the anti-malware software
