BZ2Decompressor().decompress(data)

# The data is a sequence of lines, each containing a word and a number.
# The word is a string of lower-case letters.
# The number is a 32-bit integer.
# The data is compressed with bzip2.

# Write a program that reads the data, decompresses it, and prints the
# word and the number for each line.

# The data is in a file named "data.bz2".

# Hint: You can use the bz2 module to decompress the data.

# Hint: You can use the struct module to convert the bytes to integers.

# Hint: You can use the string module to convert the bytes to strings.

# Hint: You can use the sys module to read the data from the file.

# Hint: You can use the sys module to write the data to the standard output.

# Hint: You can use the sys module to flush the standard output.

# Hint: You can use the os module to get the size of the file.
