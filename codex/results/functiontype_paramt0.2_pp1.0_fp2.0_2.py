# List comprehensions are also a good way to create a list of lists.
# For example, to create a list of lists of integers,
# you can use the following code:

[[x for x in range(10)] for y in range(10)]

# The above code creates a list of 10 lists of integers,
# where each list contains the integers from 0 to 9.

# List comprehensions can also be used to create a list of lists of lists.
# For example, to create a list of lists of lists of integers,
# you can use the following code:

[[[x for x in range(10)] for y in range(10)] for z in range(10)]

# The above code creates a list of 10 lists of lists of integers,
# where each list of lists contains 10 lists of integers,
# and each list of integers contains the integers from 0 to 9.

# List comprehensions can also be used to create a list of tuples.
# For example, to create a list of tuples of integers,
# you can use
