#The Python Interpreter
#
#The interpreter operates somewhat like the UNIX shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; 
#when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file.
#A second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shellâ€™s -c option.

#Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is best to quote command in its entirety with single quotes.
