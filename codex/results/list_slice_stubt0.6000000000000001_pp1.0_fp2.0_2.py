#A weakref can be created to a class instance with a callback function. The function is called when the instance is about to be destroyed.
#The weakref callback function is called before the instance is actually destroyed, so the instance is still accessible in the callback.
#The weakref callback function can also be used to destroy circular references.

#A weak reference to an object is not enough to keep the object alive: when the only remaining references to a referent are weak references, garbage collection is free to destroy the referent and reuse its memory for something else.
#A primary use for weak references is to implement caches or mappings holding large objects, where itâ€™s desired that a large object not be kept alive solely because it appears in a cache or mapping.
#The WeakValueDictionary class provides this behavior.
