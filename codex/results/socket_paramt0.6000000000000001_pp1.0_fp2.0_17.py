import socket
socket.if_indextoname(3)
</code>
I get the following error:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
OSError: [Errno 19] No such device
</code>
I'm not sure how to fix this and why it's not working. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
