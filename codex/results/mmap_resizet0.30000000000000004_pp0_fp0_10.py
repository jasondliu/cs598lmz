import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    print(a)
    m.close()
</code>
I am getting the following error:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap length is zero
</code>
Is there a way to avoid this error?


A:

The problem is that you are using the same file descriptor for both the file and the mmap object.  The file descriptor is a reference to the underlying file, so when you truncate the file, the mmap object is also truncated.
The solution is to use two different file descriptors, one for the file and one for the mmap object.  You can do this by opening the file twice, or by using <code>os.dup()</code> to duplicate the file descriptor.
Here is an example using <code>os.dup()</code>:
<code>import mmap
import os

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r
