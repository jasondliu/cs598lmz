import select
# Test select.select()

# select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout])
# rlist: wait until ready for reading
# wlist: wait until ready for writing
# xlist: wait for an “exceptional condition” (see the manual page for what your system considers such a condition)
# timeout: if not specified, will block until a monitored file descriptor becomes ready

# Return value: three lists of objects that are ready

# select.select() is a useful way to multiplex input/output over a number of sockets or other file objects.
# It can also be used to wait for a file descriptor to become ready for some class of I/O operation (e.g. input possible).
# The following example shows how to use select() to implement a simple, single-threaded HTTP server.
