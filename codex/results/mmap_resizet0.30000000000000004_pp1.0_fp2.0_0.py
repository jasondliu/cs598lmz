import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
This raises an exception:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
I would expect that the mmap object would be updated to reflect the truncation.
I'm using Python 3.6.4 on Windows 10.


A:

The problem is that the file is truncated before the mmap is created.
The solution is to create the mmap before the truncation:
<code>import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    a = m[:]
    f.truncate()
</code>
