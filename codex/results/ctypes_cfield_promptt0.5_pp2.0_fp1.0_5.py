# Test ctypes.CField
#
# This test is kind of a hack, since the ctypes.CField is not accessible
# in the ctypes module.
#
# ctypes.CField is used as a base class for ctypes.Field, ctypes.Array,
# ctypes.Pointer, and ctypes.Function.
#
# The ctypes.CField is a base class for the ctypes.Field, ctypes.Array,
# ctypes.Pointer, and ctypes.Pointer classes.
#
# The ctypes.CField class adds an _offset attribute to the ctypes.Base
# class.
#
# The ctypes.CField class adds an _length attribute to the ctypes.Base
# class.
#
# The ctypes.CField class adds an _type_ attribute to the ctypes.Base
# class.
#
# The ctypes.CField class adds an _name_ attribute to the ctypes.Base
# class.
#
# The ctypes.CField class adds an _pack_ attribute to the ctypes.Base
# class.
