import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    print(a)
</code>
The output is <code>b'\x01'</code>, but I expect it to be an empty byte string, because the file is truncated.
I am using Python 3.6.3 on Windows 10.
