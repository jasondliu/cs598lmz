# The LZMA algorithm is a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm,
# and is used in the .xz file format.

# The LZMAFile class provides a file-like interface for reading and writing
# data that has been compressed or can be decompressed by the LZMA library.

# The LZMAFile class supports the context management protocol.
# It can also be used as a decorator.

# The LZMAFile class supports the iterator protocol.
# Each iteration returns a chunk of decompressed data as bytes.

# The LZMAFile class supports the with statement.

# The LZMAFile class supports the context management protocol.
# It can also be used as a decorator.
