    # This test is Linux specific.  It assumes that the loopback interface
    # is named "lo" and that there is a network interface named "eth0".
    #
    # The test will fail if the loopback interface is not named "lo" or if
    # there is no network interface named "eth0".
    #
    # The test will also fail if the loopback interface is not index 1 or
    # if the network interface is not index 2.

    # The test will also fail if the loopback interface is not named "lo"
    # or if the network interface is not named "eth0".
