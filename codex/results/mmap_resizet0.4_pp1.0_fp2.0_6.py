import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
I get this error:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: cannot mmap an empty file
</code>
How can I ensure that the mmap is updated when the file is truncated?


A:

You need to call <code>mmap.resize</code> to resize the mmap object to match the new size of the file.
