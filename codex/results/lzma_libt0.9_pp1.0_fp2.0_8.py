import lzma
lzma.decompress(compressed_lzma)
```

`lzma.LZMACompressor.compress()` is used for compressing. Lastly, `lzma.LZMADecompressor.decompress()` is used for decompressing.

We also require the compression level. For LZMA, the compression level can be in an integer ranging from `0` to `9` or the value `LZMA_PRESET_DEFAULT`.

### Snappy

Snappy is a compression library that produces a compressed data format.

Snappy is a C++ library that supports compressed data. We can use the snappy Python wrapper by installing the `python-snappy` package.

We import the package as

```python
import snappy
```

`snappy.compress()` is used for compressing. Lastly, `snappy.decompress(compressed_snappy)` is used for decompressing.
