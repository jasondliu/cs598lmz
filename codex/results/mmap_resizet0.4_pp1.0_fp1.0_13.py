import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]

print(a)
</code>
The error is:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap length is zero
</code>
I would like to know why this happens and how to avoid it.


A:

The problem is that you truncate the file after you create the memory map. You need to do it before.
<code>with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    f.truncate()
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    a = m[:]
</code>
