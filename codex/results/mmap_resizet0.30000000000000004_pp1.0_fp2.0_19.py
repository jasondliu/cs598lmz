import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    m.close()
</code>
This code works fine on Linux, but on Windows it fails with an exception:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
I've found a workaround:
<code>with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    m.resize(0)
    a = m[:]
    m.close()
</code>
But I don't understand why <code>resize</code> is needed.
I'm using Python 3.5.2 on Windows 7.
