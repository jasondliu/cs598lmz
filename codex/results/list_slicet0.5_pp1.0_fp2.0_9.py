import weakref
class A(object):pass
def callback(x):del lst[0]
keepali0e=[]
lst=[str()]
a=A()
a.c=a
keepali0e.append(weakref.ref(a,callback))
del a
while lst:keepali0e.append(lst[:])

I had to use a list of lists to keep the objects alive, because a normal list, or a tuple, would be cleared by the garbage collector.
