import codecs
# Test codecs.register_error('strict', strict_errors)
with codecs.open(file, 'r', encoding='charmap') as inp:
    for line in inp:
        print(repr(line))
</code>
The last code example works without error, but I get the warning
<code>DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \x
</code>
I still have a problem, though: I don't know what all the errors are. The above codes are only examples. I have many files, and I need to find out which error to use for each file. Is there a way to find out which error to use for a given file?
EDIT
I found this example in the Python 3.2 docs:
<code>#! /usr/bin/env python
import sys, codecs

UTF8Writer = codecs.getwriter('utf8')
sys.stdout = UTF8Writer(sys.stdout)

print 'pi: Ï€'
</code>
I think that means that I need to replace 
<code>with codecs.open(file, 'r', encoding='charmap') as in
