# The ctypes module is a foreign function library for Python. It provides C compatible data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries. It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.

# The ctypes module provides a way to create C compatible data types in Python. These can then be passed to C-functions loaded from dynamic link libraries.
