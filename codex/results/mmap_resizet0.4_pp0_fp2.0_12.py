import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
The last line raises <code>ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size</code>.
I would like to understand why this happens.
I would also like to know how to solve this problem.
I am using Python 3.6.5.
