Update:
If it were me learning a new language, I would use Python 3.
I would start here, http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/ and learn the language basics, including how to download and run your own programs.
Then I would head over to tkinter, https://www.python-course.eu/tkinter_entry_widgets.php or https://docs.python.org/3/index.html and copy example programs, tweaking the code to display the output better.
Learning to autostart a program under Windows is different in basic details compared to Linux.
