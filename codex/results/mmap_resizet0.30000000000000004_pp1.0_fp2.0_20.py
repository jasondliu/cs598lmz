import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    m.close()
</code>
The last line raises an exception:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
I was expecting that the mmap would be updated with the new file size.
Is there a way to make this work?
(I know I can use <code>m.resize(0)</code>, but I'm interested in the case when the file size is reduced.)
