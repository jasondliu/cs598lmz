    # This test is not very good, because it assumes that there is at least
    # one interface on the test machine.  It also assumes that the interface
    # has a name that is a valid C identifier.
    #
    # If the machine has no interfaces, this test will fail.
    #
    # If the interface name is not a valid C identifier, this test will fail.
    #
    # If the interface name is not a valid Python identifier, this test will
    # fail.
    #
    # If the interface name is not a valid module name, this test will fail.
    #
    # If the interface name is not a valid package name, this test will fail.
    #
    # If the interface name is not a valid variable name, this test will fail.
    #
    # If the interface name is not a valid class name, this test will fail.
    #
    # If the interface name is not a valid function name, this test will fail.
