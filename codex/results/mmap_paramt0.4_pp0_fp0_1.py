import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    m[0] = bytes(2)

I expect the file to be 2 bytes long, but it is still 1 byte long.


A:

You can use <code>mmap.resize()</code> to resize the file.
<code>import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    m.resize(2)
    m[0] = bytes(2)
</code>
