# When the program exits, Tkinter canâ€™t wait for the file dialog to be closed.
# This causes Python to hang and the script never exits.
# There are two ways to avoid this issue.
# First, pressing Ctrl-C while the program is running cancels out of
# the message box, and lets the program finish normally.
# Second, adding root.destroy() at the end of the script cancels the dialog box
# immediately, and the program finishes.
