# The value of the object pointed to by the NULL pointer is None.
# This is a consequence of the fact that the value of the NULL pointer is 0,
# and 0 is the index of None in the array of built-in objects.

# The value of the NULL pointer is 0, but the type of the NULL pointer is
# a pointer.

# The NULL pointer is not the same as a pointer to None.
# A pointer to None is a pointer to an object of any type.
# The value of a pointer to None is not 0.
# The NULL pointer is a special value of every pointer type.
# The value of the NULL pointer is 0.

# The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several
# standard libraries.

# The NULL pointer is a special value of pointer types.
# It is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries.
