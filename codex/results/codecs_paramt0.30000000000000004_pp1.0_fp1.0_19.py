        path: where to cache the data (relative to `~/.keras/dataset`).
        num_words: max number of words to include. Words are ranked
            by how often they occur (in the training set) and only
            the most frequent words are kept
        skip_top: skip the top N most frequently occurring words
            (which may not be informative).
        maxlen: truncate sequences after this length.
        seed: random seed for sample shuffling.
        start_char: The start of a sequence will be marked with this character.
            Set to 1 because 0 is usually the padding character.
        oov_char: words that were cut out because of the `num_words`
            or `skip_top` limit will be replaced with this
