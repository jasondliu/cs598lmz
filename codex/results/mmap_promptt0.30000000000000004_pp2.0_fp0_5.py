# Test mmap.mmap(-1, size)

# This test is to check the behavior of mmap.mmap(-1, size) on Windows.
# The behavior is different from that on Linux.

# On Windows, mmap.mmap(-1, size) creates a file-backed mmap.
# On Linux, mmap.mmap(-1, size) creates an anonymous mmap.

# The test is to check that the file-backed mmap on Windows behaves
# like the anonymous mmap on Linux.

# This test is created to check the behavior of mmap.mmap(-1, size)
