import socket
socket.if_indextoname('3')
</code>
This returns the name of the interface, which is exactly what I want. However, this function is quite slow, and I am looking for a faster alternative.
I have tried using <code>ctypes</code> and <code>win32api</code> to access the Windows API directly, but I've found no way to do so.
I have also tried using <code>ifconfig -a</code> or <code>ipconfig /all</code> from subprocess, but the output is not very predictable, and it seems to be dependent on the Windows version, which is not ideal.
I could also use <code>netstat -nr</code> and parse the output, but this is not very reliable, as the IP address might not be the one I am looking for.
I have also tried using <code>net.if_indextoname()</code>, but this is not available on Windows.
Is there a way to get the name of an interface from its index?


A:

If you are on Python3, then you can use <code>socket.if_nameindex</code>
