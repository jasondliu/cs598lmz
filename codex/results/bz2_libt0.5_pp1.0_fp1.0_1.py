# If you want to compress data in a stream like manner, you can use a BZ2Compressor object.

# The flush() method is needed to ensure that all internal buffers are flushed.
# Otherwise, the compressed data may be missing some part of the input data.
# If you donâ€™t flush the compressor, you may not get any compressed output at all.

# You can also use a B
