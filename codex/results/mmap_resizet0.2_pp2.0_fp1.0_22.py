import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
I get the following error:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
I would expect that the <code>mmap</code> object would be updated to reflect the new file size.
Is there a way to make this work?


A:

You can use <code>mmap.resize</code> to resize the mapping.
<code>import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    m.resize(0)
    a = m[:]
</code>
