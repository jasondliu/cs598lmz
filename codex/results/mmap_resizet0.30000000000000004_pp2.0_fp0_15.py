import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
This code raises an exception:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
I think it's because the file size is 0 after truncate, but the mmap object has a size of 1.
Is there a way to truncate the file and resize the mmap object?
