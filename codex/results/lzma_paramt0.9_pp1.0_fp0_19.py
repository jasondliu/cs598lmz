from lzma import LZMADecompressor
LZMADecompressor().decompress(LZMAfile)
</code>
As stated in the documentation, this will not work as you expect. Can you help me?


A:

It turns out that the answer to my question had a very simple solution: instead of using the LZMADecompressor class, I just replaced it with 'xz'. It works for me.
