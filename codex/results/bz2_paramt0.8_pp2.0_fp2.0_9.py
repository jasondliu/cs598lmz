from bz2 import BZ2Decompressor
BZ2Decompressor().decompress(open('stackoverflow.com-Posts.7z.001','rb').read())
</code>
I opened the file with <code>HexEditor</code> to check if there is a correct magic number. It seems that the file is corrupted?


A:

Firstly, you're assuming that it is a 7zip format file. It may not be, in which case the code is simply not going to work.
However, what you're really doing wrong is using the <code>BZ2Decompressor</code> to try and decompress a whole file. The <code>BZ2Decompressor</code> is intended to decompress individual blocks of data, not a whole file, and certainly not a 7zip file. If you want to decompress a whole file, you need to use a function like <code>bz2.decompress</code>. However, as I said before, it may not be a <code>bz2</code> file. For that, you'll need to identify the compression algorithm and use a different python module.
