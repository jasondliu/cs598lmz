# The above is the code from the decompression bomb.
# It is a string of bytes that is decompressed by the BZ2Decompressor class.
# The decompressor class is imported from the bz2 module.
# The decompressor class is initialized and the decompress method is called on the compressed data.
# The decompress method returns a string of bytes that is the decompressed data.
# The decompressed data is a string of bytes that is the decompression bomb.
# The decompression bomb is a string of bytes that is a tar file.
# The tar file is a string of bytes that is a tar file.
# The tar file is a string of bytes that is a tar file.
