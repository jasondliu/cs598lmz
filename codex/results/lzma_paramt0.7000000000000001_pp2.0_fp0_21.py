from lzma import LZMADecompressor
LZMADecompressor().decompress(payload)
</code>
so, I have some issues to proceed this task.
1) what is the best way to decompress a lzma file, using python?
2) how to convert the byte string to a byte array?
3) how to reshape it and save it as image?
Thanks for your help!
