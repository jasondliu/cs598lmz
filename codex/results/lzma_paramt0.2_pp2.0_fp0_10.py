# The LZMA algorithm is also used in the .xz file format.
# The .xz format is a single-file compression format that is based on the LZMA2 algorithm.
# The .xz format is used for compressing individual files and supports the compression of multiple files into a single archive.

# The .xz format is an evolution of the earlier .lzma format, which is also based on the LZMA algorithm.
# The .lzma format is still supported by Python, but it is not as efficient as the .xz format.

# The .xz format is not supported by Python, but the lzma module provides support for working with .xz compressed files.

# The lzma module provides support for compressing and decompressing
