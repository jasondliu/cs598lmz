import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
This raises a <code>ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size</code> exception.
I would expect the <code>mmap</code> object to become invalid after the truncate. Is there a way to achieve this?


A:

I found a solution, although it's a bit hackish.
<code>import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    m.resize(0)
    a = m[:]
</code>
