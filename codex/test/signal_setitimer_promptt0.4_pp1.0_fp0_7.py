# Test signal.setitimer()
#
# This program uses signal.setitimer() to schedule a SIGALRM signal
# in 1 second, and then prints a message when the signal is received.
#
# The program terminates after printing the message.
#
# This program is a simple demonstration of signal.setitimer() and
# signal.signal().
