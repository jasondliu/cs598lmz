import select
# Test select.select()

# select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout])
# rlist: wait until ready for reading
# wlist: wait until ready for writing
# xlist: wait for an “exceptional condition” (see the manual page for what your system considers such a condition)
# timeout: if not specified, will block until a monitored file descriptor becomes ready

# Return value: three lists of objects that are ready: subsets of the first three arguments

# select.select() is a useful way to multiplex input from multiple sources.

# Example:
# The following example shows how to use select() to monitor two sockets and stdin for input at the same time.

#!/usr/bin/env python

import select
import socket
import sys
import Queue

# Create a TCP/IP socket
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.setblocking(0)

# Bind the socket to the port
server_address = ('localhost', 10000)
