# This module provides the infrastructure for defining functions in Python.
# There are two basic ways to define a function in Python: either with a
# def statement or with a lambda expression.

# Functions created with def statements are defined in the executing
# module's global scope.  The name of the function can later be reassigned
# to another value, which causes the original function to be unreachable
# (except, of course, by using the original name).
#
# Functions created with lambda expressions are compiled down to a single
# anonymous expression.  The resulting function object has no name, and can
# only be executed by immediately calling it.
#
# The code generated by def statements and lambda expressions is the same.
# What differs is the way the resulting function objects are bound to a
# name.  For def statements, the function name is
