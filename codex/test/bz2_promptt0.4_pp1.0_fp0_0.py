import bz2
# Test BZ2Decompressor

# A BZ2Decompressor object is used to decompress data incrementally.
# It is used in a while loop, and each iteration decompresses a chunk of data.

# The decompress() method reads compressed data from the compressed file object,
# decompresses it and returns it.

# Create a BZ2File object
f = bz2.BZ2File('example.bz2')

# Create a BZ2Decompressor object
decompressor = bz2.BZ2Decompressor()

# Read 1024 bytes of compressed data
