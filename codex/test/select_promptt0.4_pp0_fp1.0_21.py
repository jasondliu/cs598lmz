# Test select.select

# The first parameter is a list of sockets to check for incoming data.
# The second parameter is a list of sockets to check for outgoing data.
# The third parameter is a list of sockets to check for exceptions.
# The fourth parameter is the timeout in seconds.

# The return value is a tuple of three lists.
# The first list contains the sockets that have incoming data.
# The second list contains the sockets that are ready to send data.
# The third list contains the sockets that have exceptions.

# The timeout is the maximum time to wait for an event.
# If the timeout is specified as None, select() will block until an event occurs.
# If the timeout is 0, select() will return immediately.
# If the timeout is negative, select() will block indefinitely.
