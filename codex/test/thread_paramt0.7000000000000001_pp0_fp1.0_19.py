import sys, threading
threading.Thread(target=lambda: sys.stdin.read(1)).start()

# The line above simply starts a thread that sits and waits for a single character input. You could improve on this by having the thread print a message to let the user know that the program is waiting for a character to be pressed.

# Once you enter a character, the thread finishes and the program continues on its merry way.

# This is just a quick and dirty way to pause a program in the middle of execution.

# Another way to perform this "pause" functionality is to use the pdb module.

import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

# This line drops you into the Python debugger console, from which you can continue your program by typing continue and pressing Enter.

# There are other ways to pause a program, but this covers the most common methods.

# Question: How do you pause a program in the middle of execution?

# Answer: You can call the pdb.set_trace() function in the pdb module to enter the Python debugger console. You can also use the input() function to wait for user input to continue.
