import select
# Test select.select()

# select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout])
# rlist: wait until ready for reading
# wlist: wait until ready for writing
# xlist: wait for an “exceptional condition” (see the manual page for what your system considers such a condition)
# timeout: if not specified, will block until a monitored file descriptor becomes ready

# select() returns three lists of file descriptors: those that are ready for reading, those that are ready for writing, and those that have raised exceptions.

# select() is available on Unix and Windows.
