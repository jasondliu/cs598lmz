import select
# Test select.select
# select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout]) -> (rlist, wlist, xlist)
# Wait until one or more file descriptors are ready for some kind of I/O.
# The first three arguments are sequences of file descriptors to be waited for:
# rlist -- wait until ready for reading
# wlist -- wait until ready for writing
# xlist -- wait for an ``exceptional condition''
