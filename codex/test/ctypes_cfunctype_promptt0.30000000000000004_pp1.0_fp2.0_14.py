# The callable object returned by CFUNCTYPE can be passed to
# ctypes functions which take a function pointer as an argument.

# The callable object returned by CFUNCTYPE can be used as a
# callback function.

# The callable object returned by CFUNCTYPE can be used as a
# function pointer.

# The callable object returned by CFUNCTYPE can be used as a
# function pointer in a structure.

# The callable object returned by CFUNCTYPE can be used as a
# function pointer in a union.

# The callable object returned by CFUNCTYPE can
