# The LZMA file format is described in the XZ Utils source code:
# https://tukaani.org/xz/xz-file-format.txt

# The LZMA file format is a container format. It contains a header and a
# compressed stream. The header contains a dictionary size, a compression
# mode, and a CRC32 checksum. The compressed stream is a sequence of chunks.
# Each chunk contains a compressed block and a CRC32 checksum.

# The LZMA file format is not supported by the LZMADecompressor class.
# The LZMADecompressor class supports only the compressed stream format.
# The compressed stream format is a sequence of chunks. Each chunk contains
# a compressed block and a CRC32 checksum.
