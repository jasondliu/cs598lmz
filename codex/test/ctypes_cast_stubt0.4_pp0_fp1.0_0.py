import ctypes
ctypes.cast(id(int), ctypes.py_object).value

# The ctypes.cast() function can be used to cast a ctypes type to any other type.

# The ctypes.pythonapi module contains a number of functions and variables that can be used to access Python C API functions.

# For example, the following code calls the PyObject_Str() function, which returns a Python string object from the given object:

import ctypes

# Load the shared library into ctypes.
