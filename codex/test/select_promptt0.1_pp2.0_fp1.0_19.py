import select
# Test select.select()

# select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout])
# rlist: wait until ready for reading
# wlist: wait until ready for writing
# xlist: wait for an “exceptional condition” (see the manual page for what your system considers such a condition)
# timeout: if not specified, will block until a monitored file descriptor becomes ready

# Return value: three lists of objects that are ready

# select.select() is a useful way to multiplex input/output over a number of sockets or other file-like objects.

# The following example shows how to use select.select() to monitor a number of sockets (including standard input) for activity.

import sys
import socket
import select

host = ''
port = 50000
backlog = 5
size = 1024
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind((host,port))
server.listen(backlog)
input = [server,sys.stdin]
running = 1
