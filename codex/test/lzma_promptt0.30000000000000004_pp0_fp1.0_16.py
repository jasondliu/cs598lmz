# Test LZMADecompressor

# LZMA is a compression format that is based on the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding.
# It is used in the 7z format and can be decompressed using the LZMA SDK.

# The LZMADecompressor class can decompress data incrementally.
# This is useful when decompressing data that is not available all at once,
# such as when reading from a network stream or a file-like object.

# The decompressor object can be used as a context manager.
# This ensures that the close() method is called when the with statement is exited.

# The decompressor object can also be used as a context manager.
# This ensures that the close() method is called when the with statement is exited.

# The decompressor object can also be used as a context manager.
# This ensures that the close() method is called when the with statement is exited.
