import ctypes
# Test ctypes.CFUNCTYPE()

# This test is for the ctypes module.

# The ctypes module allows to call functions exported from dlls/shared
# libraries and has extensive facilities to create, access and use
# simple and complicated C data types in Python - in full dynamic typing
# style.

# The CFUNCTYPE() function creates a C callable function from a Python
# callable.

# The C callable can be passed to a foreign function exported from a dll.
