# Test LZMADecompressor

# LZMADecompressor is a stateful incremental decompressor object for the LZMA
# compression format.

# The LZMA format supports only one compression algorithm so far: LZMA.
# The LZMA compression algorithm is very complex and supports many different
# compression settings.

# The LZMA decompressor object can be used in one of two ways:

# 1. Read all compressed data from a file-like object using read()
# 2. Feed compressed data in chunks using decompress()

# The decompressor object can be used as a context manager.

# The LZMA decompressor object can be used to decompress data that was
# compressed using any compression level and any compression preset.

# The decompressor object can be configured to not check the CRC32 checksum of
# the uncompressed data.

# The decompressor object can be used to decompress data that was compressed
# using the LZMA1 or LZMA2 algorithm.

# The decompressor object can be used to decompress data that was compressed
# using the LZMA1 or LZMA2 algorithm.
