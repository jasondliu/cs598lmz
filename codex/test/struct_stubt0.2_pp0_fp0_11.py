# __new__() is a static method, so it can be called on the class, not an instance.
# It is called before __init__() and is used to return a new instance of your class.
# In this case, we return an instance of Struct.
# The __init__() method is then called on this new instance, with the format string as its argument.
# The size attribute of the new instance is then printed.
