import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
This gives me 
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
Is there any way to get the expected result, a byte <code>b'\x01'</code>?


A:

As the question's comments indicate, you're looking for the <code>mmap.resize</code> method.
