I'm using Python 3.7.3.
I assumed that <code>f.truncate()</code> should not do anything as the file is already empty.
I'm trying to understand the behavior of the code above.


A:

From the documentation:
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>&lt;code&gt;truncate()&lt;/code&gt;</code> method truncates the fileâ€™s size. If the optional size argument is present, the file is truncated to (at most) that size. The size defaults to the current position. The current file position is not changed.</p>
</blockquote>
So it seems that truncating to 0 is the default.
