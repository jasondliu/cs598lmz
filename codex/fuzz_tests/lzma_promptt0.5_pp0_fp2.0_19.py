# Test LZMADecompressor.decompress()

# This is a simple test to check if the LZMADecompressor.decompress() method
# works correctly. I found a bug in the LZMA library (which is used by the
# LZMADecompressor class) that has been fixed in the latest version.

# This test will fail if the LZMA library is not up to date.

# The test uses a sample file that contains the following text:
#
#     hello world
#
# The sample file was compressed with the following command:
#
#     xz -9 sample.txt
#
# The file 'sample.txt.xz' was then included in the test suite.

# Read the compressed file.
with open('sample.txt.xz', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Create a LZMADecompressor object.
decompressor = lzma.LZMADecompressor()

# Decompress the data.
result = decompressor.decompress(data)

# Check that the decompressed data is correct
