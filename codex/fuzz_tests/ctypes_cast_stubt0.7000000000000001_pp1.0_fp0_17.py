# Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below. 
# The following values are considered false: 
# None, numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets).
# All other values are considered true.

# The is operator tests for object identity. 
# This isnâ€™t the same as equality, although a and b contain the same content.
# The == operator tests
