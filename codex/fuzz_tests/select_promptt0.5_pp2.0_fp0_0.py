import select
# Test select.select()

# select.select() is a blocking function that returns a list of file descriptors that are ready to be read. 
# The function takes 3 lists as arguments:
# (1) the first list contains all the file descriptors that we want to check if they are ready to be read
# (2) the second list contains all the file descriptors that we want to check if they are ready to be written to
# (3) the third list contains all the file descriptors that we want to check if they have raised an error

# The return value is a tuple of 3 lists, each containing the file descriptors that are ready to be read, written to, and raised an error respectively.
# The function returns immediately if any of the file descriptors are ready to be read, written to, or raised an error.

# The function is usually used to check multiple file descriptors for readiness before performing a blocking IO operation on them.

# Example:

# The following example uses select.select() to check if a socket is ready to be read.
# The socket is created using socket.socket(), and the socket is connected to the localhost on port 8080.
