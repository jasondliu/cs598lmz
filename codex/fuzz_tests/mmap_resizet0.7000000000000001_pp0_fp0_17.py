import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
Running the above code yields:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
How can I flush changes to a file without losing the associated mmap?


A:

I'll put my answer from the comments as an answer, because it works:
<code>with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    m.resize(0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
