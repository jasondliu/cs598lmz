import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    print(a)

The output is <code>b'\x01'</code>.
I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but I think you should be able to do it without truncating the file.
