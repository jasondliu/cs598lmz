import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]

This code raises an exception:
<code>mmap.error: [Errno 22] Invalid argument
</code>
Is there a way to truncate a file which is mmapped?


A:

You can't.
The <code>mmap</code> module has a <code>resize()</code> method, but it only works if the file is opened with <code>MAP_SHARED</code> and the operating system supports it.
The documentation says:
<blockquote>
<p>If the file is opened for writing, this method may increase the file size. If the file is extended, the contents of the new area are undefined. The fileâ€™s size is not changed by this method if it is decreased.</p>
<p>On Windows, if the file is opened for writing, the file size can only be increased.</p>
</blockquote>
