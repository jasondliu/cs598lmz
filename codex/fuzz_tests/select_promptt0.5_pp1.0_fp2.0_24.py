import select
# Test select.select()

# select.select() takes three lists of sockets (or file descriptors) as arguments
# and returns a list of sockets that are ready for I/O.

# The first list is the sockets to watch for incoming data.
# The second list is the sockets to watch for outgoing data.
# The third list is the sockets to watch for exceptions.

# A socket is ready for I/O if it is in one of the lists and has data to read or space to write.

# This is a simple echo server. It listens for incoming connections and echoes back whatever
# data it receives.

# This server is designed to handle multiple connections simultaneously.
# It uses select.select() to determine which sockets have data to read.
# It then iterates over those sockets and reads data from them.
