import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
The last line raises <code>ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size</code>.
I was expecting the <code>mmap</code> object to be updated when the file is truncated.
Is there a way to achieve this?


A:

The <code>mmap</code> object is not updated when the file is truncated.
You can use <code>mmap.resize</code> to resize the <code>mmap</code> object.
<code>import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    m.resize(0)
    a = m[:]
</code>
