import ctypes
# Test ctypes.CFUNCTYPE

# This is a test of the ctypes.CFUNCTYPE function.
#
# The CFUNCTYPE function is used to create C function pointer types.
#
# The CFUNCTYPE function takes the following parameters:
#
# - The return type of the function.
# - A tuple of the argument types.
# - A boolean indicating whether the function uses the stdcall calling convention.
#
# The CFUNCTYPE function returns a new class which represents the function type.
#
# The new class has the following methods:
#
# - __call__(self, *args) - Call the function.
# - from_address(address) - Create a function object from a memory address.
# - from_param(param) - Convert a parameter to a form that can be passed to the function.
#
# The new class has the following attributes:
#
# - argtypes - A tuple of the argument types.
# - restype - The return type.
#
# The new class can be passed as a function pointer to another C function.
#
# The new class can also be called
