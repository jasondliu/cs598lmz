import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]

Thanks


A:

The solution is to check <code>m.size()</code> first, and if it is zero, that means that the file was truncated.
<code>import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    if m.size() &gt; 0:
        a = m[:]
</code>
