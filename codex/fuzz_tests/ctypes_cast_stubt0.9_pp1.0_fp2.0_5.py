# Problem 4: Create a list of the first 10 integers
# and square each one using a list comprehension.

# Problem 5: Create a list of the cube roots of the first 100
# non-negative integers.

# Problem 6: Create a list of the first 100 even integers.

# Problem 7: Create a dictionary called ``foods`` storing strings of food
# names as keys, and the number of calories in the food as values. You can
# use the following data (or make some up on your own):

#     'chips' : 300
#     'coke' : 170
#     'carrot' : 30
#     'apple' : 70
#     'milk' : 130

# Problem 8: Access the calorie data for a given ``food`` and store in a 
# variable called ``calories``.

# Problem 9: Create an array holding the names of all foods in ``foods`` 
# with more than 100 calories per portion.

# Problem 10: Create an array holding only the calorie counts of the food
# items in ``food
