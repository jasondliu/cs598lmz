# The LZMA library provides in-memory compression and decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.

# The LZMA library is based on code from the XZ Utils project and uses the same file format.

# The LZMAFile class is provided as a convenience to easily read and write .xz-compressed files.

# The LZMAFile class is not able to write compressed data.

# The LZMAFile class is not able to seek in the compressed data stream.

# The LZMAFile class is not able to read compressed data from a file opened in text mode.

# The LZMAFile class is not able to read compressed data from a file opened in append mode.
