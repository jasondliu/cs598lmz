# Test ctypes.CField
#
# This test module is for testing the ctypes.CField class.
#
# The ctypes.CField class is used to define fields in ctypes Structures.
# It is a subclass of ctypes.Field, and adds the functionality of
# packing and unpacking the field data.
#
# The ctypes.CField class is used internally by ctypes.Structure,
# and is not meant to be used directly.

import unittest
from ctypes import *

# The following are tests for the ctypes.CField class.

class TestCField(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_CField(self):
        # Test the CField class.

        # Create a CField instance.
        # The arguments are the name of the field, the type, and the offset.
        field = CField("field_name", c_int, 0)

        # The CField class has a pack method that packs the data
        # according to the type.
        # The pack method takes a single argument, the value to pack.
        # The pack method returns a string containing the packed
