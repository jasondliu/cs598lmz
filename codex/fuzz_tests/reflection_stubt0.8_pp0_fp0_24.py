fn = lambda: None
gi = (i for i in ())
fn.__code__ = gi.gi_code
fn()
</code>
This seems to work fine:

<code>fn.__code__</code> is a <code>code</code> object.
<code>gi.gi_code</code> is not a <code>code</code> object, but it looks very similar.
<code>fn</code> can be called without a TypeError being raised.

However, this is probably a bad idea, because:

It's very likely to be considered undefined behavior, since an object that is not a <code>code</code> object is assigned to a <code>__code__</code> attribute.
It's likely to break in future versions.
It's likely to break in other Python implementations.

Example of it breaking:
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; gi.gi_code
&lt;code object &lt;genexpr&gt; at 0x7f4a4a37bb90, file "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; gi.gi_code.co
