import sys, threading

def run():
    for i in range(0, 1000):
        print "running..."
        time.sleep(0.01)

for i in range(0, 10):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=run, args=())
    thread.start()

Output:
<code>running...
running...
running...
running...
running...
running...
running...
running...
running...
running...
</code>
EDIT:
The output is not ordered because the OS decides when to schedule a thread to run.
I guess the OS will try to schedule threads as much as possible to run on different cores.
