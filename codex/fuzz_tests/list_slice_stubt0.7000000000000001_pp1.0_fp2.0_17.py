#A weak reference, as the name implies, does not keep the referent alive: when the last strong reference to the object is removed,
# the weakly referenced object is automatically removed from the weak reference.
# This can be used to write cache-like structures: the object can remove itself from the cache when the last strong reference is removed.
#It can also be used to implement the Observer pattern (see PEP 318):
# the subject and the observer have weak references to each other to avoid reference loops:
# when the last strong reference to either one is removed, the corresponding object is automatically removed from the otherâ€™s weak reference list.

#The module defines the following functions:

#weakref.ref(
