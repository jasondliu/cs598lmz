# The ctypes module provides a way to create a Python object from a pointer
# to a C-allocated object. This is done by calling the cast() function,
# passing it the pointer and the type of the object to create.
# The cast() function returns a ctypes object which, when dereferenced,
# returns the Python object.
# The value attribute of the ctypes object is the Python object.

# The ctypes module can also be used to create a pointer to a Python object
# and pass it to C code.

# The ctypes module can also be used to wrap C functions and pass Python
# objects to these functions.

# The ctypes module is a foreign function library for Python. It provides
# C compatible data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared
# libraries. It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.
