import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, prot=mmap.PROT_READ)
    print(m[0])
    f.write(bytes(2))
    print(m[0])

I want to know, how exactly is it possible?
I tried to do something similar with <code>ctypes</code>, but I haven't found a way to access the memory from the file.
The documentation says:
<blockquote>
<p>Note that modifications to the file itself are not allowed through the
  mmap object. In some cases, you can use msync() to force the changes
  made to the mmapâ€™ed region to disk.</p>
</blockquote>
But I am not even trying to modify the file and get the changes from mmap, I am just trying to get the changes from the file and get them with mmap.
