import lzma
lzma.LZMAError:
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/lzma.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    from _lzma import *
ImportError: liblzma.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</code>
I have tried to install liblzma-dev, but it does not solve the problem.
How can I solve this problem?
