    - Modified to include a delay time by Victor Zaccardo on 2016.03.25.

    - Modified
        - to correct extreme right and extreme bottom behavior,
        - to stay inside the screen whenever the tooltip might go out on
          the top but still the screen is higher than the tooltip,
        - to use the more flexible mouse positioning,
        - to add customizable background color, padding, waittime and
          wraplength on creation
