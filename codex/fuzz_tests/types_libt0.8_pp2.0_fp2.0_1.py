import types
types.FunctionType(c.__call__, globals(), 
    {"a": "b", "c": "d"})
</code>
I can call this function (<code>func</code>) before the <code>return</code>, but not in the caller.
How can I use <code>types.FunctionType</code> to construct the function so that I can call it elsewhere?


A:

You can't, at least not directly. The <code>__call__</code> function is a special method that is used to define what happens when you call an object (i.e. <code>c()</code>). However, you can define a <code>__call__</code> method for a class and then create an instance of that class.
If you'd like to directly call a method, you can use the <code>types.MethodType</code> function. If the method is a static method, then you can use <code>types.StaticMethodType</code>. That being said, I don't see how this would fit into your use case here (and you also haven't shown what use case you're trying to accomplish).
