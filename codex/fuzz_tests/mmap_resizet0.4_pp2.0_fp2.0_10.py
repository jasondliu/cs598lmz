In this example, the <code>mmap</code> object is not closed, and the file is truncated.
The <code>mmap</code> object is still valid, but the file is truncated.
Is this behavior guaranteed by the Python language?


A:

No, this is not guaranteed. 
The behavior you are seeing is a result of the implementation of the <code>mmap.mmap</code> class. 
The <code>mmap</code> class is implemented in C, and it is not clear how it is implemented. 
For example, the <code>mmap</code> class is implemented in the <code>mmapmodule.c</code> file, but the <code>mmap</code> class is defined in the <code>mmap.py</code> file.
