# Test select.select()

# select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout])
# rlist: wait until ready for reading
# wlist: wait until ready for writing
# xlist: wait for an “exceptional condition” (see the manual page for what your system considers such a condition)

# Return value: three lists of objects that are ready

# select.error: exception raised in case of an error

# select.select() can be used to wait until a file descriptor is ready for reading, writing or has an exceptional condition pending.

# The first three arguments are sequences of file descriptors to be waited for: rlist, wlist, xlist.

# The optional timeout argument specifies a time-out as a floating point number in seconds. When the timeout argument is omitted the function blocks until at least one file descriptor is ready. A time-out value of zero specifies a poll and never blocks.

# The return value is a triple of lists of objects that are ready: subsets of the first three arguments. When the time-out is reached without a file descriptor becoming ready, three empty lists are returned.

# When the time
