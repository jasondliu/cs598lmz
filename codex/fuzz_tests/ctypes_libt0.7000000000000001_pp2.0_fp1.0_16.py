Is there any way at all I can get around the above error?


A:

As it turns out, the above code works fine. The problem was that the code was within a loop (to be precise, a <code>try</code> block within a <code>while</code> loop), and for some reason, the exception thrown was being caught by the outer loop. My guess is that, as the exception was thrown from a different thread, it was caught by the outer loop, and the popup box was never displayed. My solution was to add <code>pass</code> to the <code>except</code> clause in the outer loop, which allowed the popup box to be displayed.
