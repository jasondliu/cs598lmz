__label__2 Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I\'m in a good mood it makes me feel better.

Life is too short to be down. Life is too short to be unhappy. Life is too short to not love the people you love. Life is too short to not love yourself. Life is too short to not love Pat Benatar. She is a great singer and this CD proves it. Go out and buy it now. You will not be disappointed.
