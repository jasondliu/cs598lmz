# bzip2 is a compression algorithm that is not part of the standard library.

# The bz2 module provides a comprehensive interface for the bz2 compression library. It implements a complete file interface, one shot (de)compression functions, and types for sequential (de)compression.

# The bz2 module contains:

# An open() function like the one in the built-in open() but with different parameters.
# A BZ2File class, with methods read(), readline(), readlines(), write(), writelines(), seek(), and close().
# A compress() function like the zlib.compress() function, but taking only one parameter for the string to compress.
# A decompress() function like the zlib.decompress() function, but taking only one parameter for the string to decompress.
# A BZ2Compressor and BZ2Decompressor class, which can be used to compress and decompress data sequentially.

# The bz2 module does not contain any built-in compression. To compress data using bzip2, you need to install the bzip2 library.
