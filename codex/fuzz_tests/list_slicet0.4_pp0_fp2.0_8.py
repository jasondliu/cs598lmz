import weakref
class A(object):pass
def callback(x):del lst[0]
keepali0e=[]
lst=[str()]
a=A()
a.c=a
keepali0e.append(weakref.ref(a,callback))
del a
while lst:keepali0e.append(lst[:])
print len(keepali0e)
</code>
I think the problem is about the <code>weakref</code> callback, but I don't know how to fix it.
