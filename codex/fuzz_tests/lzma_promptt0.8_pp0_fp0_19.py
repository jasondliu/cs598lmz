A:

The file format is described in the lzma man page. Basically, it consist in a header, followed by the actual compressed data. The header contains information about the algorithm used for the compression, how is was done, and other metadata.
In the case of the file you have, the header is 18 bytes long. You can skip it, and start feeding the decompressor right after it.
The header is constructed as follows:

5 bytes: The first byte is always 0xFD, and the remaining 4 bytes are the compressed size of the data (using little endian encoding). <code>0xFDFFFFFFFF</code> means that the uncompressed size is unknown. No data appears after the specified size.
Additional bytes: The next byte contains the version of LZMA used to compress the data. The version is encoded in the first 2 bits. The next 4 bits are the log_2 of
