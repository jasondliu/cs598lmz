import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    print(a)
</code>
This code throws an exception:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size
</code>
How can I get the data from the file?


A:

You can't. The mmap object is a view of the file, and you truncated the file.
