# This example is based on the documentation, but uses the
# ctypes.c_int32 type rather than the ctypes.c_long type.
# The ctypes.c_long type is a 64-bit integer on 64-bit
# platforms.

# The documentation says that the return type of the
# callback is c_long, but the example does not return
# a value.

# The documentation says that the callback takes two
# parameters, but the example does not use the parameters.
