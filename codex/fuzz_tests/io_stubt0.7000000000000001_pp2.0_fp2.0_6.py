import io

class File(io.RawIOBase):
    def readinto(self, buf):
        global view
        view = buf
    def readable(self):
        return True

f = io.BufferedReader(File())
f.read(1)
del f

I can't find any way to keep view alive, even when I use it as a base class. The documentation says nothing.
