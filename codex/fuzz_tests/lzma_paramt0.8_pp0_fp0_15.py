from lzma import LZMADecompressor
LZMADecompressor().decompress(BytesIO(b'\xfd\x37\x7a\x58\x5a\x00\x00\x04\x00\xff\x08\x00\x00\x00')).decode('utf-8')

# return ''
```

It looks like we have to pass `0x37fd` to `decompress()`, so we add an `if` statement to the decompress() function to test if the first two bytes of the data are `0x37fd`, if it is, we assume it is lzma data and we create a lzma object, pass the data to it, and return the result, if not, we assume it is base64 data and return the result of base64 decoding. Now it works:

```python
>>> b = BytesIO(b'\xfd\x37\x7a\x58\x5a\x00\x00\x04\x00\xff\x08\x00\x00\x00')
>>> decompress(b)
