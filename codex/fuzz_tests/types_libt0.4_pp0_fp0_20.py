# It binds the function object to the instance object.
# It also binds the function object to the class object.

# The first argument is the function object.
# The second argument is the instance object.
# The third argument is the class object.

# The function object is the function that will be called when the method is called.
# The instance object is the object that the method will be bound to.
# The class object is the object that the method will be bound to.

# The function object can be any callable object.
# The instance object can be any object.
# The class object can be any object.

# The function object is the function that will be called when the method is called.
