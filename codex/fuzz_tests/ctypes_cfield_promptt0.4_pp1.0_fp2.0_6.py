# Test ctypes.CField

# ctypes.CField is a class used to describe the fields of a structure.
# It is used to create the fields of a structure, and also by the
# Structure class to create the fields of a structure.

# ctypes.CField(name, type, offset, bits)
# name is the name of the field, type is the type of the field,
# offset is the offset of the field in the structure, and bits
# is the number of bits of the field.

# This test is based on the test of ctypes.CField in the
# test_ctypes.py file.

# This test is used to test the ctypes.CField class.

# Create a CField object.
field = ctypes.CField('value', ctypes.c_int, 0, 32)

# Check the name of the field.
assert field.name == 'value'

# Check the type of the field.
assert field.type == ctypes.c_int

# Check the offset of the field.
assert field.offset == 0

# Check the bits of the field.
assert
