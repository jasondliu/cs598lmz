import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
The last line throws
<code>ValueError: mmap length is zero
</code>
which makes sense. But then, how do I truncate a file that is mapped in memory?


A:

Just call <code>mmap.resize</code> after truncating the file:
<code>with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    m.resize(f.tell())
    a = m[:]
</code>
