 * Criteria class for the {@link com.jhipster.demo.invoice03.domain.Invoice} entity. This class is used
 * in {@link com.jhipster.demo.invoice03.web.rest.InvoiceResource} to receive all the possible filtering options from
 * the Http GET request parameters.
 * For example the following could be a valid request:
 * {@code /invoices?id.greaterThan=5&attr1.contains=something&attr2.specified=false}
 * As Spring is unable to properly convert the types, unless specific {@link Filter} class are used, we need to use
 * fix type specific filters.
