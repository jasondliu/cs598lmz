# Test select.select()
#
# This test program is used to test whether select.select() works correctly.
# It uses a pipe to communicate with a child process.
#
# The child process writes a byte to the pipe every second.
# The parent process uses select.select() to wait for the pipe to become readable.
# When the pipe becomes readable, the parent process reads the byte from the pipe.
#
# The test passes if the parent process reads a byte from the pipe every second.
