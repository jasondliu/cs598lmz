import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
</code>
This code raises <code>ValueError: mmap offset is greater than file size</code>.
I think it's because <code>f.truncate()</code> doesn't change the file size immediately.
How can I truncate the file without raising the exception?


A:

You can use the <code>mmap.resize</code> method to resize the mmap object:
<code>with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    m.resize(0)
    a = m[:]
</code>
