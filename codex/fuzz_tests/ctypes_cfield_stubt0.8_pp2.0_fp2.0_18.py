import ctypes

class S(ctypes.Structure):
    _fields_ = [('x', ctypes.c_int)]

Then define a class that extends ctypes.CField:
<code>class OverloadedCField(ctypes.CField):
    """
    Base class for overloaded versions of ctypes.CField.
    """
    pass

def overload(cls):
    """
    A decorator that indicates that this class has overloaded version of
    ctypes.CField.
    """
    return cls

@overload
class CustomCField(OverloadedCField):
    """
    This class overrides some methods of ctypes.CField.
    """

    @property
    def value(self):
        """
        Calculate the field's value.
        """
        ...

    def set(self, p, val):
        """
        Set the field's value.
        """
        ...

    def __repr__(self):
        """
        Return a string representation of the field's value.
        """
        ...
</code>
Then create a metaclass that can replace the ctypes.CField with the overloaded class if it exists:
<code>class
