    # This test is Linux specific.
    #
    # The test assumes that the loopback interface is named 'lo' and that
    # the first non-loopback interface is named 'eth0'.
    #
    # The test also assumes that the loopback interface has index 1 and
    # that the first non-loopback interface has index 2.
    #
    # If the test fails, it is likely that the interface names or indexes
    # have changed.
    #
    # If the test fails, the test can be fixed by changing the names and
    # indexes in the test.
    #
    # If the test fails, the test can also be fixed by changing the
    # interface names and indexes in the test to match the names and
    # indexes on the test system.

    # If the test fails, the test can also be fixed by changing the
    # interface names and indexes in the test to match the names and
