from _struct import Struct
s = Struct.__new__(Struct)
print(s.__doc__)

"""
The above prints a help doc string that is generated by the dynamic class
created by Struct.__new__. However, the doc string shows the dynamic class name
as 'Struct', which is the name of the base class. The doc string should probably
use the dynamic class name instead of the base class name because the base class
isn't what the class was created from. This can be seen in the following example
where a dynamic class is created from the str class.

python3 -c 'from _struct import Struct; s = Struct.__new__(Struct); print(s.__class__.__name__)'
Struct

python3 -c 'from _struct import Struct; s = Struct.__new__(str); print(s.__class__.__name__)'
str

python3 -c 'from _struct import Struct; s = Struct.__new__(Struct); print(s.__doc__)'
Format codes for the pack/unpack routines.
