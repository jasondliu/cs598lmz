import mmap

with open('test', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(bytes(1))

with open('test', 'r+b') as f:
    m = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
    f.truncate()
    a = m[:]
    print(a)
</code>
I get the following error:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    a = m[:]
ValueError: mmap length is zero
</code>
What is the correct way to truncate a file and keep the mmap?


A:

You can't. The mmap is a view of the file, and the file is now empty.
