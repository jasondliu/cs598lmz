from bz2 import BZ2Decompressor
BZ2Decompressor().decompress(bz2.decompress(f.read()))
</code>
The code I have tried and obviously it is not working.
What can I do to decompress the file?
Thanks in advance!


A:

You have decompressed the file twice.
<code>f = gzip.open('compressed.gz', 'rb')
file_content = f.read()
</code>
<code>file_content</code> is a byte sequence that has been compressed by gzip.
<code>bz2.decompress(file_content)
</code>
is a byte sequence that has been compressed by bz2.
<code>BZ2Decompressor().decompress(file_content)
</code>
is a byte sequence that has been compressed by bz2.
The result of the first decompression is a byte sequence that has been compressed by bz2, which is why the second decompression worked.
