import select
# Test select.select()

# select.select() takes three lists of file descriptors and waits until
# some of them are ready for some kind of I/O.
# The first list is the list of file descriptors to be checked for being
# ready to read.
# The second list is the list of file descriptors to be checked for being
# ready to write.
# The third list is the list of file descriptors to be checked for error
# conditions.
# The return value is a triple of lists of file descriptors: the subsets
# of the first three arguments that are ready for I/O.

# The following example shows how to use select() to wait until a
# particular socket is ready for reading.

import sys
import select

server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

server_address = ('localhost', 10000)
print >>sys.stderr, 'starting up on %s port %s' % server_address
server.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections
