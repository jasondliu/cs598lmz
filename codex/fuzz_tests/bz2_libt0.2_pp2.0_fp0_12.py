# For example, if you are compressing log files, youâ€™ll get much better compression if you first

# $ python3 -m bz2 -d compressedfile.bz2 > originalfile.txt

# The bz2 module is not capable of directly reading and writing compressed files.
# Instead, it provides a very high-level interface for working with bzip2 compression.
