2. Tried ROT13 but there was no luck
3. Since it's a cipher reference challenge, I googled "python ciphers" and could get https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-ciphers.
4. Downloaded the file and ran
```python
from ciphers.vigenere import *
passwd = 'hobojam'

decrypt_vigenere(_, key).decode()

# 'self.h2_raw(self.ex_secret,'
```
5. Rest is easy ;)
