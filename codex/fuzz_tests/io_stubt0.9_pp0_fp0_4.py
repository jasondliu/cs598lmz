Initially, we have an empty <code>view</code> and a <code>f</code> that keeps the <code>File</code> object alive.
When we call <code>f.read(1)</code>, we're reading one byte into our <code>view</code>, because that's what the <code>File</code> object does.
When we <code>del f</code>, the <code>BufferedReader</code> destructor runs, and it needs to flush the buffer. So it calls its <code>readinto</code> method. (You can see this if you add a <code>print</code> in the <code>readinto</code> method.)

At this point, we have a <code>BufferedReader</code> object that needs to read more bytes into its internal buffer using its <code>readinto</code> method. But its internal <code>raw</code> attribute is <code>None</code>â€”we can see that with <code>print(f.raw)</code> before the <code
