# LZMA is a lossless data compression algorithm that uses a combination of LZ77, Huffman coding, and arithmetic coding. It is used in the 7z format and can give better compression than bzip2.

# LZMA is the default and general compression method of the 7z format. It provides a high compression ratio and fast decompression, so it is very suitable for embedded applications.

# The LZMA file format contains a header, followed by a stream of data, followed by an optional index.

# LZMA compression is very CPU-intensive, so it is not recommended to use it on a low-end CPU.

# LZMA is an improved version of LZ77, so it can be decompressed with a LZ77 decompressor.
