A:

You can use the Threading library to run the above code in parallel. You can also use the multiprocessing library if you have more than one core on your machine. This allows you to run multiple processes in parallel.
<code>import sys, threading

def run():
    # Add your code here!
    for i in range(1000):
        for j in range(1000):
            print(i, j)

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=run)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=run)
thread1.start()
thread2.start()
</code>
