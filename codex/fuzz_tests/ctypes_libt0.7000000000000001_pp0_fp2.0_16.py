import ctypes
ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTitleW("Title")
</code>
However, I don't know how to do that with a script that I wrote. I assume it will be using the <code>ctypes</code> library, but I have no clue how to do that.
If it is, how can I do it?


A:

There is a <code>ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTitleW</code> function, which you can call like this:
<code>ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTitleW("Title")
</code>
