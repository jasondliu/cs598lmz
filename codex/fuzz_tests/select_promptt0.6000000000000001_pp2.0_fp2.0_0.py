# Test select.select for reading
#
# The select.select() function takes three parameters -
# three lists of objects. One list is for reading,
# one for writing, and one for exceptions.
#
# The function blocks until one of the objects is ready
# for the requested operation or until a timeout occurs.
#
# It returns the three lists of objects that are ready
# for the requested operation.
#
# If the timeout expires, the three lists will be empty.
#
# The timeout value is in seconds.
#
# If the timeout is zero, the function does not block.
#
# If the timeout is negative, the function blocks indefinitely.
#
# The select.select() function returns three lists of objects
# that are ready for the requested operation.
